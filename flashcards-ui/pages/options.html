                You can run this application offline.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application should run perfect with Android 2.2+ devices and IOS devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also an application available on the Android market. If you're on Android,
                I recommend you to install it instead of using the application within the browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you think you're done with current word set, you can always fetch the next set manually.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't need to fetch sets manually at all, because the next set is
                automatically fetched when you went through all the words in current set.
            </p>
            <button id="nextSet" data-inline="true" data-mini="true">Fetch next word set</button>
            <p>
                A word set contains 100 entries and they're kept in your device. Thus, you can use the application offline (through your browser or the Android app).
