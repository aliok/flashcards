                You can run this application offline. If you access this application from your browser, just bookmark the page
                and you can open it when you're offline. If you access this application within the Android app, Chrome web store app or IOS web app, the application
                can run offline already.
            </p>
            <p>
                This application runs perfect with Android 2.2+ devices and IOS devices. For more information, please visit
                <a href="https://github.com/aliok/flashcards" target="_blank">
                    here.
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>
                There is also an application available on 
                <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tr.com.aliok.flashcards">Android market</a>. 
                If you're on Android, I recommend you to install it instead of using the application within the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, a Chrome Web Store application is available
                <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ijecamokjmiajijbajfnlbkfknpplkdf">here</a>.
                You can install it on your Google Chrome.
            </p>

                If you think you're done with current word set, you can always fetch the next set manually.
            </p>
            <p>
                You don't need to fetch sets manually at all, because the next set is
                automatically fetched when you went through all the words in current set.
            </p>
            <button id="nextSet" data-inline="true" data-mini="true">Fetch next word set</button>
            <p>
                A word set contains 100 entries and they're kept in your device. Thus, you can use the application offline (through your browser or the Android app).
