============
A flash cards application for learning German [articles(artikel)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_(grammar)).

The application is hosted on Google App Engine with this URL: [http://the-flashcards.appspot.com](http://the-flashcards.appspot.com)

Consists of 3 modules:
* flashcards-data-service : Data provider for the application. Python + Google App Engine project. 
	
	The service responses with the words(along with articles and English translation) of a specified count (currently 100) and a user key.
	If the same user key is given to the service for the next time, the service returns the next set. If no user key is passed, then it returns the first set.
	
	See the module's README for more details.
	
* flashcards-ui : The UI part for the application. Python + Google App Engine + CofeeScript + JQueryMobile + Html5 project.
	
	UI part interacts with the user and asks user to identify the articles for given nouns, as well as providing some more features.
	
	See the module's README for more details.
	
* flashcards-wordset-generator : This module generates the word sets. Python project.

	It goes through Wikipedia articles, follows links to Wikipedia articles until a certain point and determines the frequency of the words in an existing dictionary. 
	Thus, the most frequent words can be asked first.
